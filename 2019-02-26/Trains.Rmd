#1.  Source data
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

   library(tidyverse)
   library(janitor)
   
   trains_raw <- read_csv ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-02-26/full_trains.csv") %>%
   clean_names()
```


#2a.  Transform raw data
```{r}

   trains <- trains_raw %>%
      select (year, month, departure_station, arrival_station, journey_time_avg, total_num_trips) %>%
      arrange (-total_num_trips) %>%
      filter (year == 2017)
```


#2b.  Prepare data for network diagram
```{r network}

   departures <- trains %>%
      distinct(departure_station) %>%
      rename(station = departure_station)
   
   arrivals <- trains %>%
      distinct(arrival_station) %>%
      rename(station = arrival_station)

   nodes <- full_join(departures, arrivals, by = "station") %>%
       rowid_to_column("id")
   
   per_route <- trains %>%  
     group_by(departure_station, arrival_station) %>%
     summarise(trips = n()) %>% 
     ungroup()
   
   edges <- per_route %>% 
     left_join(nodes, by = c("departure_station" = "station")) %>% 
     rename(from = id) %>% 
     left_join(nodes, by = c("arrival_station" = "station")) %>% 
     rename(to = id) %>%
     select(from, to, trips)
```   


#3.  Visualize
```{r}
   
   library(tidygraph)
   library(ggraph)
   
   routes_tidy <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, directed = TRUE)
   
   ggraph(routes_tidy) +
      geom_edge_link() +
      geom_node_point() +
      theme_graph() +
      scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 2)) +
      geom_node_text(
         aes(label = station),
         size = 2, repel = TRUE
      ) 
```
